This often helps machine learning models learn and converge faster. Some machine learning models are not *scale invariant*, meaning their ability to learn from the data can be impacted by the scale of the features. For example, models might give more influence to features with larger scales, implying that these features are more important than others, even when they should be treated with similar importance. Scaling features helps mitigate this issue.\n",

        "Now that we have two models, we need to assess them. It's important to think critically about which metric you're using to measure model performance and why. There are many metrics you can use to evaluate models.\n",

        "Metrics:\n",
        "* Accuracy = $\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+FN+FP+TN}$ - for an imbalanced dataset like this one, accuracy is usually not the best metric, as one can get nearly 90% accuracy just by predicting the majority class.\n",
        "* Recall/Sensitivity = $\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$ - intuitively, recall is the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples. A model with high recall has few false negatives, and thus fewer positive cases may be missed.\n",
        "* Precision = $\\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$ - intuitively, precision is the ability of the classifier to not label a negative sample as positive. A model with high precision has few false positives, and thus fewer negative cases that are misidentified as positive.\n",
        "* F1-Score = $2 \\times \\frac{Precision \\times Recall}{Precision + Recall}$ - can be thought of as an \"average\" (actually the harmonic mean) of precision and recall and is high if there is a good balance between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our setting, the cost of missing a potential subscriber (false negative) is usually higher than incorrectly predicting a non-subscriber (false positive). Therefore, getting a high recall may be slightly more important than getting a high precision in this case. F1-Score is a great metric to look at for a balanced approach between not sacrificing too much recall or precision. However, we should not rely on accuracy as an indicator of model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that in machine learning we care mostly about model performance on *unseen* data (i.e. test data), but it is useful to look at the training metrics as well to see if the model is overfitting or underfitting.\n",
        "\n",

        "* For each of your models, compute the performance using each of the above metrics on the training and testing sets\n",

        "We will now examine another type of classifier: XGBoost. XGBoost is an optimized implementation of gradient boosting designed for speed and performance. It builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous ones. XGBoost includes regularization to prevent overfitting and can handle large, complex datasets efficiently. It support parallelization, making it faster than other gradient boosting implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        " As mentioned, XGBoost trees are built sequentially, with each tree correcting the errors of the previous ones. In contrast, Random Forest (next section) combines the results of independently built trees for final predictions. XGBoost includes regularization to prevent overfitting and supports parallelization during tree construction, making it faster and more accurate in certain scenarios. Random Forest, on the other hand, is typically more robust to hyperparameter tuning and easier to train but may not achieve the same level of performance on structured data as XGBoost.\n",

        "\n",
        "In machine learning, there are typically two sets of parameters. The first being the model parameters. These are typically the parameters that are used to model the data directly, and these are learned through some sort of optimization problem. An example of these would be the weights in a linear regression model (Recall: $y=\\beta^Tx=\\beta_1x_1+\\beta_2x_2+\\cdots+\\beta_mx_m$, $\\beta$ are the model parameters). The second are the *hyperparameters*, and these typically control the learning algorithm. Hyperparameters influence the way the model learns or fits the model parameters to the data, and as a result influences model performance. Some example of hyperparameters include the learning rate in a neural network, the class weight we used in our logistic regression model earlier, or optimization method in a linear regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tuning** is the process of finding the set of hyperparameters that yield the best model parameters for the given data set. As you saw in 3.3, we define *best* loosely here as that depends on the specific problem being worked on. Here we will be using the logistic regression model to provide a introduction to hyperparameter tuning."
